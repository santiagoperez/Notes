### 7.1 Debugging & Analyzing React Apps

Browser console allows us analyzing warning errors so that we can act on it. They link us to the proper code line/s which are getting affected. 

We can also set breakpoints through the console. In *Sources* we can navigate through the source code and allow us to enter in debug mode, stopping in the breakpoints we set where we can analyze (surfing the variable pool in *scope*, or checking the call stack) every state and check that the app is behaving properly.

### 7.2 Using the React DevTools

React DevTools is a browser extension that extends the browser console by letting us visualizing the component tree on a living app. It extracts the components only from every other DOM element. 

With React DevTools we have a closer understanding on the react portion from our app. We can modify in the fly elements to see how do they react as well.
