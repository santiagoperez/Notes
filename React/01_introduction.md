# React

## 1. Introduction

Modern framework to build UI on top of JS.

React can be used 

- to control parts of HTML pages in a **widget** approach for **Multi Page Applications**. Server render pages here, react control a part of this page (widget)

- to use **Single Page Applications** where server sends only one HTML pages and react controls the UI

### 1.1 Alternatives:

- **Angular**: uses TypeScript. Has more built-in features (routing)

- **Vue.js**: mixed between Angular and react. Include also core features like routing. Less overload than Angular.
