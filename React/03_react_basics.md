### 3.1 React fundamentals

React is a framework on top of JS, so we leverage their syntax. It simplifies enormously JS code when building complex, interactive and reactive UIs

Uses **Components** which make an UI. A component is a building block. Combination of JS, HTML, CSS. Can be reusable. You build individual components and tell react how to bring them together.
